A 3D Cube which rotate it along an axis that passes through its center.
The rotating object decelerate at a rate of ‘2’ degrees /sec2 before it comes to a standstill.
The Cube responds as follows to the following user inputs
  
   1. Touch generates friction that should decelerate the rotation further by a Y (friction factor)
   2. Swipe: Accelerates or decelerates the rotating object as per the difference in velocity between
      rotation and swipe with the friction factor Y.

Tool Used :
   Used basic graphics of Canvas ( HTML5 ) and javaScript ( without any javaScript library ) .
